        The Feynman method of learning.
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
        The Feynman method of learning was devised and popularized by the world renowned and Nobel peace prize winning, American Physicist, Richard Feynman. This method of learning doesn't ensure good grades as this is a very time consuming method of learning but it sure as hell ensures actual learning. If grades are your priority, this probably is not the best method to use.

    <p class="paragraph">
        This learning method makes use of teaching as a tool of learning, which is mildly ironic. It is comprised of 4 steps. First, Pick a topic to study and gain as much understanding of it as possible. Second, try to portray your understanding in writing as though you are teaching the topic to a child. Third, analyze your writing and see if there are gaps in your understanding or have a hard time simplifying and putting certain parts into words, if so, highlight those parts. Fourth, repeat from the second step to simplify the highlighted parts in the third step to present the topic in a completely simplified manner. Sometimes, simplification and use of analogies can be slightly wrong compared to what goes on in the actual process but its fine as long as it gives the general idea needed to understand the topic.

        For example, "Heat is the sum total of the kinetic energy of the molecules of a matter." is understandable to us but if you tell that to a booger eating child, it'll just sound gibberish and it'll continue eating boogers. However, if we say, "When we rub our hands, they get warm and similar to that when molecules rub against each other, they also get warm. So, heat is just the total addition of all the warmth produced by the rubbing of molecules against each other." to the child, it may understand and maybe it'll wash it's booger hands and learn about double entry book keeping or something, I dont know.
