            Nihilism is a philosophical idea that outright rejects the existence of inherent meaning in everything. It's essentially, pessimism and skepticism on steroids. For example, an optimist sees the glass half full, a pessimist sees the glass half empty and a nihilist doesn't even see why it matters. "Half full? Half empty? It doesn't matter, nothing matters. We are all nothing but a bunch of monkeys that could communicate better, eventually we will die and be forgotten." You get the point.

            Now, it may seem like that this is a philosophical idea that no one would apply in their daily lives but, you would be wrong. Nihilism is a fairly popular philosophical idea and the funny part is, most people don't pick it up willingly and are not even aware they're nihilistic. Most commonly it is seen in people who have lost their loved ones because the only way to reduce the pain of loss of a loved one, is by convincing yourself that existence itself is a burden and they were spared of its cruelty. Other times, it is commonly seen in people with misanthropic tendencies.

            You might be wondering, "How does this miserable philosophy even be accepted willingly by people?" Well, if you really thought that, congrats. You're not a coward. Happiness, friends, families, etc don't last. Every beginning has an end. So, if we don't begin anything, nothing will end. You can't be more miserable if you are already miserable, now can you? People who willingly use Nihilism are outright afraid of losing happiness once they gain it, so they just trap themselves in misery. In simple words, they're cowards.

            For some Nihilists the illusion of "Truth" that Nihilism provides is a major trapping factor. They believe that their view is the true one and the others are just ignorant of the truth but, what even is "Truth"? Truth is a concept that is vague in itself and to think that Nihilism provides them with necessary tools to see the world for what it is, ironically, is ignorant as hell.

            I'm not denying that humans are rotten by default but, that is not all the world offers. If there are shadows, then there must be light. For every 10 rotten individuals, a few good ones exist. I have seen a few people try to put a positive spin on Nihilism but, if everything is meaningless, doesn't putting a positive spin on Nihilism also meaningless? Nihilism is the void of all philosophies, it extinguishes all hope, reason and purpose, it brings nothing but misery, it is a philosophy of despair.
