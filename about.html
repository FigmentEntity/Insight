        A minimalesque site where I store my thoughts, knowledge, etc. Also, the site doesn't work in laptops or large screens,since I made it for mobile phones only because that's the commonly used medium of browsing through the internet. You can use the contact section to email me questions or just say hi. [I will find you and steal your foreskin if you send phising links -with love, me.]
