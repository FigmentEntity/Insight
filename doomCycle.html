    <div class="heading">
        The cycle of meaningless pleasure and how to break it.
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Most of us get trapped in a cycle of meaningless and mind numbing periods of time where we scroll through short form media content either in the form of shorts, reels, posts or tiktoks. These periods can last from an hour to 5 hours. You gain periodic self awareness in these time frames where a voice tells you to stop but you keep scrolling and your mind gets numbed by the meaningless pleasure again. Once these time frames are over, most of us are filled with regret, shame and guilt and even if we do have a few hours to work, we won't because at this point we say, "Today was a bad day, I will be disciplined and won't procrastinate from tomorrow onwards." to ourselves and sleep or get back into the loop of meaningless pleasure. Of course, tomorrow comes and you're still the same. 
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">This happens because our brains seek the path of least resistance by default. From an evolutionary point of view, this was designed to reduce unnecessary load on the brain but it sort of has become a defect in the modern day. Our brain is incredibly smart but still pretty stupid at the same time. Meaningful and purposeful activities such as studying, thinking about a solution, etc are paths of high resistance that yield great pleasure in the long run but still your brain won't pick any of those because why pick them and get greater fulfiling pleasure later when you can get massive amounts of  meaningless pleasure right now with ease and no pain? Essentially, your brain is shit at thinking in long run because it was primarily wired to think in the short term.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Now, we can't exactly change our default programming but what we can do is change what our "Path of least resistance" is through embracing discomfort and boredom. Currently social media, music and youtube is your current path of least resistance so now what I need you to do is completely cut the distractions, cold turkey. If you have to use youtube or any other social media for work or educational purposes, set alarms to ring every hour so that you get snapped out of a doom cycle of shorts incase you get trapped and write down what you did in the past hour to figure out where you went wrong and what was your thought procedure. Now you might be thinking, "This is completely unsustainable and way too drastic", well you aren't fully wrong in that sense because you don't exactly understand how damn adaptable our brain is. Right now it might seem outright impossible but it will eventually adapt to the new routine. If you're bored, do pushups, read books, walk outside or even just sleep, this is much better than having you doom scroll through meaningless content. After a day like this, your brain will slightly adapt to the lack of stimulation and working or studying will start to become your paths of least resistance because it's either that or you rot in boredom. Also, you will need to now schedule your days and actively work towards a goal or work to develop certain skills as the lack of purpose and order will end up increasing the strength and frequency of the urges.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">"An empty head is the workshop of the devil."</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Some changes such as increased self awareness, constant thinking, increased focus, a sense of peace, etc can be experienced. Also, don't worry, the pain you feel in the first few weeks and the massive amounts of urges to get back on the mind numbing forms of entertainment will eventually subside to the point where it won't even bug you. In my case the urges became managable in the first 2 weeks alone and at around month 2.5, it just became what I am, a part of my identity of sorts.</p>
